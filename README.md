# Pre-Flight Review

This is a prototype of an AI-powered code review assistant that runs before a developer opens a pull request.

It’s intentionally scoped: two files with four AI-generated comments that require review. This demo explores how AI can fit into the rhythm of engineering work without creating friction. Especially for lower-stakes PRs, refactors, doc updates, or “rubber-stamp” changes, Pre-Flight Review can nudge toward better quality with minimal interruption.

This UI is intentionally simplified. In a real implementation, this experience could be embedded into the IDE or the PR view. But for now, this demo is here to simulate the moment: click “Pre‑Flight Review,” and get instant feedback.

This demo is a proposa for how we might shift trustable review left. Not with heavy automation, but with the kind of small, fast feedback that teams actually want.
